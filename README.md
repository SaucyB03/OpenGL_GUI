## About this Repo:
- This Repo was created as a side project to OpenGL-Space-Sim, so check that out at: https://github.com/SaucyB03/OpenGL-Space-Sim.git

## What this is?
Im creating a customizable GUI class that I can implement into my OpenGL Space Simulation Project. Since as of right now that project is quite static on runtime. I want to be able to add edit and remove planets after runtime. Something that is not currently implemented but will soon once this is complete.
